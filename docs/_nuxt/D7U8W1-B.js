Recently, he's been focused on developing AI-powered solutions that solve real business problems through intelligent automation and data processing.":e.includes("ai")||e.includes("machine learning")||e.includes("artificial intelligence")?"Subhi has deep expertise in AI-driven system architecture. He specializes in designing systems that integrate AI capabilities into scalable applications. This includes developing data pipelines for efficient model training, implementing real-time and batch inference systems, and creating architectures that allow for continuous model improvement. He takes a pragmatic approach to AI integration, focusing on solutions that deliver tangible business value rather than implementing AI for its own sake.":e.includes("approach")||e.includes("methodology")||e.includes("process")?"Subhi approaches projects with a balance of technical excellence and business pragmatism. He typically begins with a thorough discovery phase to understand core requirements and constraints. He's an advocate for clean, maintainable code architecture and follows agile methodologies with regular demos and client feedback. What sets his approach apart is his emphasis on knowledge transfer - he ensures clients understand the technical decisions made and provides comprehensive documentation. This collaborative style helps create solutions that not only meet immediate needs but are sustainable for the long term.":e.includes("team")||e.includes("enablement")||e.includes("mentor")?"Subhi's team enablement services focus on elevating engineering teams through technical assessment, custom training programs, and leadership development. He begins with a comprehensive evaluation of the team's current capabilities, workflows, and pain points. Based on this assessment, he creates tailored programs that might include hands-on workshops, pair programming sessions, code reviews, and technical mentoring. His goal is to not just improve technical skills but to help teams establish better processes, communication patterns, and engineering cultures that lead to sustainable high performance.":e.includes("experience")||e.includes("background")||e.includes("history")?"Subhi has over 15 years of software development experience across diverse industries.

His DevOps philosophy centers around creating infrastructure as code, ensuring environments are consistent, reproducible, and well-documented.":e.includes("legacy")||e.includes("modernization")||e.includes("upgrade")?"Subhi takes a pragmatic approach to legacy system modernization. Rather than suggesting complete rewrites (which are often risky), he typically advocates for incremental modernization strategies. This might involve gradually extracting functionality into microservices, improving test coverage, implementing API layers over legacy systems, or creating clear boundaries between old and new code. His experience with OpenedX at Doroob.sa demonstrates his ability to maintain legacy applications while strategically modernizing components over time.":e.includes("communication")||e.includes("work style")||e.includes("collaboration")?"Subhi places a high value on clear, transparent communication. His working style is collaborative, with an emphasis on regular demos, feedback cycles, and knowledge sharing.
